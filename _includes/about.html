                    <p>Since 2020, I have been dedicated to iOS development, having played a pivotal role in a significant project. My expertise spans Swift, both UIKit and SwiftUI, Xcode, Realm Database, and the deployment of iOS apps. I am well-versed in REST API integration. Additionally, my background includes three years as an Android developer utilizing Java and the Android SDK Framework, alongside proficiency in C# for Windows Mobile and SQL databases.</p>

                    <p>On the business area, I worked supporting other companies to grow, improving their management and processes, using diagnostics to find their pain points and then applying the right tools/technologies for their needs. Despite not programming during that time I had opportunity to learn more about new technologies, project management, customer success, responsibilities of home office and meetings' management.</p>
