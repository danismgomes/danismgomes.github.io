                    <p>Bachelor in Computer Science with a diploma in Mobile Development, I am always searching for ways to improve my surroundings. I love to be connected with people. Researching, learning and helping others are which makes me in love with my work. As a mobile developer, I worked 2 years with Java using the Android SDK Framework, C# for Windows Mobile and SQL databases. I also have experience developing apps for iOS with Swift and Objective-C.</p>

                    <p>On the business area, I worked supporting other companies to grow, improving their management and processes, using diagnostics to find their pain points and then applying the right tools/technologies for their needs. Despite not programming during that time I had opportunity to learn more about new technologies, project management, customer success, responsibilities of home office and meetings' management.</p>
