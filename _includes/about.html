                    <p>As a mobile developer, I worked 2 years with Java using the Android SDK Framework, C# for Windows Mobile and SQL databases. I also developed apps for iOS with Swift and Objective-C. On the business area, I worked supporting other companies to grow, improving their management and processes, using diagnostics to find their pain points and then applying the right tools/technologies for their needs.</p>
